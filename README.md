# M3RCH 

M3RCH Clothing is an eCommerce clothing application built using React with Redux and Hooks, Firebase for authentication, OAuth and collection data,
  Node and Express.js for handling server-side Stripe credit card payments, Sass and Styled Components for visual styling, 
  GraphQL for API requests.
  
I built this application with the intent on creating a reactive, performant, and large scale application with technologies/methodologies I had not used
before. Some of these include: Thunk, NoSQL databases, Redux Sagas, Express, React Hooks and GraphQL.
